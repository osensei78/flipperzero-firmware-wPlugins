 * Pure, deterministic "stable-hybrid" speed/progress model (no furi, no I/O, no floats).
 *
 * The vehicle always rolls forward; the mounted wheel SHAPE and the TERRAIN kind at the
 * vehicle's current position tune how fast it advances (see domain/shapes.h). This is not a
 * physics engine: sim_step looks up shape_speed_factor for the terrain under the vehicle,
 * eases the current speed toward that target, and advances distance by the eased speed.
 *
 * Fixed-point scale: values are represented as `real_value << SIM_FP_SHIFT`, i.e. Q(SIM_FP_SHIFT)
 * fixed-point. `SIM_FP_ONE` is the fixed-point representation of the integer value 1, handy for
 * callers/tests comparing against "about one game-x-unit".
