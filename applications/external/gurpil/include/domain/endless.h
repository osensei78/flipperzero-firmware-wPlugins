/*
 * Pure, deterministic endless-mode checkpoint timer (no furi, no I/O, no floats).
 *
 * The vehicle never "dies" from the terrain in endless mode: the only fail condition is running
 * out of time. The run starts with a time budget; every ENDLESS_CHECKPOINT_SPACING units of
 * distance tops the timer back up (capped at ENDLESS_MAX_TIME_MS). The top-up SHRINKS with each
 * checkpoint already crossed (endless_checkpoint_bonus_ms) — a rising-difficulty treadmill: early
 * on the bonus exceeds the time it takes to cross a gap so good play banks time, but as the bonus
 * decays past that crossing time even optimal play bleeds and eventually runs out, so every run is
 * finite and distance is the score. The caller owns the clock and the sim's distance; this module
 * only advances state given an elapsed `dt_ms` and the current distance.

 *   2. `time_left_ms` is depleted by `dt_ms`, saturating at 0 (never underflows/wraps).
 *   3. While `state->distance >= next_checkpoint`: add endless_checkpoint_bonus_ms(checkpoints_hit)
 *      to time_left_ms (capped at ENDLESS_MAX_TIME_MS) and into last_bonus_ms, advance
 *      next_checkpoint by ENDLESS_CHECKPOINT_SPACING, and increment checkpoints_hit. Looped so
 *      several checkpoints crossed in one big jump each grant their own (decaying) bonus.
