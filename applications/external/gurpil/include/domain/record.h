/* Pure, host-testable best-distance record codec: serialize/parse + update.
 *
 * A record is the best (highest) distance a player has achieved. It is persisted as a
 * fixed-size little-endian byte buffer with a magic/version marker for corruption detection.
 * The record is non-negative (int32_t >= 0). File I/O is handled elsewhere (Task 9);
 * this module is pure serialization/parsing + keeping the maximum.
 */

 * little-endian distance = 8 bytes total. Allows future extension without breaking
 * existing buffers. */

 *
 * Returns: number of bytes written (RECORD_BYTES on success, 0 if out_len < RECORD_BYTES).
 * Writes nothing and returns 0 if the output buffer is too small.
 *
 * The buffer layout is:
 *   Byte 0: magic marker (0x42)
 *   Byte 1: version (0x01)
 *   Bytes 2-3: reserved (set to 0x00)
 *   Bytes 4-7: distance as little-endian int32_t

 *   - the magic byte (byte 0) is not 0x42, or
