/*
 * The furi isolation boundary for this app: everything below `app/`, `views/` and `scenes/`
 * stays plain C so it host-tests with gcc; this header (and the app/views/scenes files that
 * include it) are the only place furi/gui types appear.
 *
 * Classic Flipper menu shape, mirroring the firmware's own scene-driven apps (see e.g.
 * applications/examples/example_number_input and applications/main/ibutton): a Submenu-backed
 * Menu scene (Play / How to play / Credits) sits at the base of the SceneManager's scene stack;
 * Play pushes the Game scene (wrapping the existing game loop via GurpilGameView), How to play
 * and Credits each push a Widget text scene. Every leaf scene Backs out to Menu for free via
 * SceneManager's own default back-event handling (see include/scenes/gurpil_scene.h); Back at
 * Menu — the base of the stack — is what actually exits the app.
