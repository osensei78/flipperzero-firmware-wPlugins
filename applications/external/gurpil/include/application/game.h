/*
 * Pure per-tick orchestrator (no furi, no I/O, integer only) tying together the sim (distance/
 * speed/vehicle height), the endless checkpoint timer, and the player-mounted wheel shape into
 * one game state. The caller (UI/hardware layer) owns the real time source and the RNG seed;
 * this module never reads either itself — both arrive as plain arguments.
 *
 * Design choice: `game_start` moves endless straight to EndlessRunning instead of leaving it
 * Idle until the player's first shape input. Endless mode's whole point is the timer counting
 * down from the very start of a run, so the countdown should be live immediately; there is no
 * "waiting room" phase. `game_tick` only advances the sim while endless is Running (see below),
 * so the vehicle simply doesn't move until the caller starts ticking — an idle player loses time
 * but not distance.
