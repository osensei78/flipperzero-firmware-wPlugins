/*
 * The furi View wrapper around the game itself: owns a GameState plus the wheel-spin frame
 * counter and the persisted `best` shown in the HUD/game-over overlay, all inside the View's own
 * model (ViewModelTypeLocking — see src/views/gurpil_game_view.c) so the Game scene's FuriTimer
 * (a different thread) and the GUI thread's draw/input callbacks never race, mirroring the
 * firmware's own PowerOff view (applications/services/power/power_service/views/power_off.c).
 *
 * The pure gameplay (game_start/game_tick/game_is_over/... in include/application/game.h and the
 * canvas rendering in include/views/game_view.h) is unchanged; this module only adds the
 * furi/View plumbing around it so it can run as one scene under the app's ViewDispatcher.
