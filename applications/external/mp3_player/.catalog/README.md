# MP3 Player

A real MP3 player for the Flipper Zero. Copy ordinary MP3 files to your microSD card and play them. No desktop conversion, no special encoding.

Created by Coolshrimp.

## Three outputs

Pick one under Settings, Output. Only one runs at a time.

* **Internal** plays through the Flipper's built-in sounder using a custom 10-bit PWM carrier.
* **MAX98357A** sends 15-bit mono I2S audio to a MAX98357A amplifier module at 16 kHz.
* **PAM8403** sends a 500 kHz pulse-density stream on pin 3 that an external RC filter turns into the analog signal a PAM8403 board expects.

## Internal output is not ideal

Internal playback works, but the Flipper's internal sounder is a piezo buzzer, not a music speaker. Expect buzzy, low-fidelity sound, and expect it to be **very quiet** even at 100% volume. That is a hardware limitation of driving a piezo element from a GPIO PWM carrier. It is not something the app can fix.

**An external MAX98357A module, or a properly filtered PAM8403, is strongly recommended.** Both are dramatically louder and cleaner, and volume control still works: the app scales the audio in software before it reaches the amplifier, so the volume keys behave the same on every output.

## Any MP3 bitrate plays

The decoder reads the bitrate from each frame header, so every MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG-2.5 Layer III bitrate from 8 kbps to 320 kbps plays. Constant and variable bitrate files are both supported, including mixed-bitrate files.

Sample rates of 8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1 and 48 kHz are all resampled automatically for the selected output. Mono and stereo, CRC-protected frames and free-format streams are supported. ID3v2 tags and embedded album art are skipped without loading artwork into RAM.

Files that are not really MP3 audio will show an error. That includes AAC, M4A, WMA or FLAC renamed to .mp3, DRM-protected content, and severely damaged files.

## Controls

Song List:

* **Up and Down** move through the list.
* **OK** opens Now Playing and starts that song.
* **Back** returns to the main menu.

Now Playing:

* **Up and Down** change the volume.
* **Left and Right**, short press, skip to the previous or next song.
* **Left and Right**, held down, seek backward or forward in five-second steps.
* **OK** plays and pauses.
* **Back** returns to the song list.

Seeking resumes only if the song was playing before the hold. A paused song stays paused.

The About screen lists the full pinout for both amplifier modules and scrolls with Up and Down.

## Music folder

The default library is /ext/music. To change it, open Settings, highlight Music folder and press OK. A folder browser opens on the SD card:

* **OK** on a folder name enters that folder.
* **OK** on ".." goes up one level.
* **OK** on "Use this folder" saves the current location and rescans the library.
* **Back** leaves the browser without changing the folder.

Older versions read the folder from music_path.txt. If that file exists it is imported automatically the first time this version runs, after which the setting lives in the app's own settings file.

Only MP3 files directly inside the chosen folder are read, and subfolders are ignored. The scan stops after five seconds, 1024 directory entries, or 100 songs. Keeping the library flat leaves enough RAM for the decoder.

Volume, repeat mode, output selection and the music folder persist between launches.

## Open from file browser

On firmwares whose file browser can open an MP3 with this app, the app starts straight on Now Playing and plays that file, without loading the library.

## MAX98357A wiring

Wire a MAX98357A breakout to the Flipper GPIO header as follows:

* BCLK to pin 5, which is PB3.
* DIN to pin 2, which is PA7.
* LRC or LRCLK to pin 4, which is PA4.
* VIN to pin 1, which is 5 V.
* GND to any GND pin.

Connect the module while the Flipper is powered off. Do not connect either speaker lead to ground. On battery power the app enables the 5 V OTG rail during playback and disables it afterward. GPIO signals stay at 3.3 V logic even though the amplifier runs from 5 V. The module needs no MCLK or I2C setup, so leave the SD and GAIN pads at their board defaults.

## PAM8403 wiring

Pin 3, which is PA6, carries a raw pulse-density stream. It must never go straight to the PAM8403 input. Build a simple RC low-pass filter from pin 3 to the board's L and R inputs, with each input fed through its own 1 kOhm resistor. Power the board's 5 V input from Flipper pin 1 and tie its ground to Flipper GND.

Never connect either speaker terminal to ground, never join the left and right speaker outputs, and never feed the speaker outputs into another audio input. Pin 1 can power light testing. For higher output use a separate regulated 5 V supply for the amplifier, join its ground to Flipper GND, and do not connect that supply back into pin 1.

## Limitations

* Internal output is quiet and buzzy by nature. Use a MAX98357A or a filtered PAM8403 if you can.
* Folder recursion is disabled, so keep MP3 files directly in the selected folder.
* Output is mono, resampled to 15.625 kHz for Internal and PAM8403 or 16 kHz for MAX98357A.
* MP3 decoding is CPU and memory intensive on the STM32WB55. Very high bitrate or unusual files may underrun.
* Native 44.1 and 48 kHz output remains future SAI work.
