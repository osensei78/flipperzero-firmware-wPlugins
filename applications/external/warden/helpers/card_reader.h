/* Warden's read layer.
 *
 * A worker thread drives the onboard NFC field as a *poller* (never a listener):
 *   1. NfcScanner sweeps every protocol and reports the full stack present on the
 *      card (e.g. Iso14443_3a -> Iso14443_4a -> MfDesfire).
 *   2. A short base-layer poll (ISO14443-3A / -3B / -15693 / FeliCa) pulls the
 *      activation data every access system keys on: the UID, plus SAK/ATQA on
 *      the A family. That is all Warden needs to grade the card.
 *
 * We only ever READ the anticollision/activation response. No sectors are
 * decrypted, no keys are exercised, nothing is written back. The card leaves in
 * exactly the state it arrived. */
