# I2C Tools CLI

A Flipper Zero external application that exposes I²C tools through both a **GUI** and a **serial CLI** (the *i2c* command over *ufbt cli* / VCP).

Forked from [NaejEL/flipperzero-i2ctools](https://github.com/NaejEL/flipperzero-i2ctools) (GPL-3.0). On top of the original scanner / sender / sniffer / infos views, this fork adds:

- **N-byte read** in the sender view (1..32 bytes, adjusted via Long Left / Long Right);
- **Write mode** toggle on the sender view (Long OK switches between READ and WRITE);
- **HEX / ASCII** display toggle (Long Back), with scrollable result paging (Long Up / Long Down);
- A **serial CLI** with subcommands **scan**, **probe**, **read**, **write**, **help**.

**⚠ Warning:** the Flipper external GPIO is **3V3 only**. Connecting a 5 V bus directly to SCL/SDA can damage the device. Use a level shifter for 5 V peripherals.

## Wiring

| Flipper pin | I²C signal |
|---|---|
| C0 | SCL |
| C1 | SDA |
| GND | GND |

Internal 10 kΩ pull-ups are enabled by the external I²C handle.

## Install

**From the Flipper Application Catalog** — search for **I2C Tools CLI** on the [Flipper catalog](https://catalog.flipperzero.one/) and install through qFlipper or the mobile app.

**From source (development)** — requires [ufbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt). Then run **ufbt** to build the FAP into dist/i2c_tools_cli.fap, **ufbt launch** to build + upload + start on a connected Flipper, or **ufbt cli** to open the serial CLI (then type *i2c help*).

## CLI quick reference

- **i2c scan** — list addresses that ACK.
- **i2c probe** *addr* — report present / absent for one address.
- **i2c read** *addr* *reg* *count* *{hex | ascii}* — write the register, then read N bytes (default format: hex).
- **i2c write** *addr* *reg* *byte* *{byte...}* — up to 32 payload bytes.
- **i2c help** — print usage.

All numeric arguments are hex (1A, 0x1A, 0X1a, …).
