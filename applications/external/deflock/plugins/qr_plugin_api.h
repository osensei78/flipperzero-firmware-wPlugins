/**
 * @file qr_plugin_api.h
 * ABI between the app and the QR encoder plugin. Included by BOTH sides.
 *
 * WHY THE ENCODER IS NOT IN THE APP -- the Flipper's loader has to place each
 * ELF section of a .fap in one contiguous allocation, and users on heavier
 * firmware were being refused with "Not enough RAM to run the app" (issue #5).
 * Nayuki's QR generator is ~4.6 KB of that image and is reachable from exactly
 * one screen (Share to DeFlock), so it is loaded on demand and dropped again on
 * the way out. Peak memory while the QR is on screen is unchanged; every other
 * screen is 4.6 KB cheaper, including the moment of loading, which is the
 * moment that was failing.
 *
 * The .fal ships INSIDE the .fap as a file asset (fal_embedded), so this stays
 * a single-file install -- download flipdeflock.fap, copy it, done.
 *
 * VERSIONING: bump QR_PLUGIN_API_VERSION on any change to QrPluginApi. The
 * loader refuses a mismatched plugin rather than calling through a stale
 * layout, and the app treats a refusal as "feature unavailable", never as a
 * crash.
