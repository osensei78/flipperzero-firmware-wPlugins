 * @file esp_parser.h
 * Companion wire-protocol parser: line text -> plain tagged record.
 *
 * Pure logic (only flock_db + libc), so it is host-testable with adversarial
 * line fixtures. `esp_link.c` owns the thin adapter that applies a parsed record
 * to ReconApp; keeping parse and mutate separate is what makes the wire protocol
 * unit-testable (parse != mutate).
 *
 * The companion emits one record per line, comma-separated:
 *   FLOCKCO,<ver>                       version banner (-> connected)
 *   S,<frames>,<hits>,<ch>[,<deauths>]  status heartbeat
 *   WBEGIN / W,<bssid>,<rssi>,<ch>,<auth>,<pair>,<grp>,<wps>,<ssid> / WEND
 *   BBEGIN / BLE,<addr>,<rssi>,<cat>,<company>,<name>[,<mfghex>][,rv=1] / BEND
 *   D,<mac>,<rssi>,<ch>,<type>,<conf>,<ssid>[,fp=<hex32>][,cls=a][,hid=1]  detection
 *   DA,<bssid>,<ch>                     deauth/disassoc attack target
 *   ATK,<kind>,<value>                  active attack-tool signature
 *   LOC,<rssi>                          live Locator RSSI
