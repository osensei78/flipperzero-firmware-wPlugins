 * @file plugin_host.h
 * Load/unload a FlipDeFlock plugin from the app's own asset directory.
 *
 * The heavy, rarely-reached modules (the QR encoder; the ESP32 flasher) ship as
 * .fal files embedded in the .fap and are mapped into RAM only while the screen
 * that needs them is open. That is what keeps them out of the contiguous
 * allocation the loader must find at launch -- the failure users were hitting
 * (issue #5).
 *
 * FAIL-SAFE BY CONTRACT: every function here returns NULL/void on any problem
 * -- missing asset directory, version mismatch, corrupt .fal -- and never
 * traps. A caller that gets NULL must show "unavailable" and let the user back
 * out. The asset directory can legitimately be missing (a user who copied the
 * .fap onto a card the firmware has not extracted assets for yet), so treating
 * that as fatal would turn a cosmetic problem into a dead app.
