 *
 * A hit was previously silent -- it appeared as a new row on a screen you had to
 * be looking at, so a camera detected while driving went unnoticed until well
 * past it (GitHub issue #1). WHEN to alert is decided by the pure, host-tested
 * flock_alert_should_fire() in detect_rules.h; this file only owns HOW it sounds.
 *
 * Firmware-only (it names SDK notification messages), so it stays out of the
 * host test build.
