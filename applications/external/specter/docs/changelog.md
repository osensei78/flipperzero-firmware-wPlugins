# Changelog

## 2.3

- **Fix: the field meter never went above ~31%, even resting on a reader.** The gauge was showing raw carrier duty-cycle. Readers *poll* — a burst, a sleep, another burst — so a typical terminal only radiates 20–35% of the time and the raw number **saturates** near 30% no matter how close you get. Nothing was mis-detected; it was displayed on the wrong scale. The meter is now mapped against that real polling band, so sitting on a reader reads **~90–100%** instead of 31%.
- Two knock-on bugs fixed by the same change: the proximity words `CLOSE` and `STRONG` were **unreachable** (they need ≥45/≥70 on a scale that stopped at ~31, so it only ever said `FAINT`/`NEAR`), and Site Survey's "peak ≥ 50" test for an `ACTIVE READER` verdict could **essentially never fire** for a polling reader — the exact device Specter is built to find.
- New `MAX` proximity word: the meter says when it is **pegged**, so a needle that stops moving reads as saturation rather than a fault.
- New **Settings → Meter** toggle: `Boost` (default, full-scale) or `Raw` (the literal duty-cycle, as before).
- The raw duty is still the source of truth everywhere it matters — noise floor, auto-calibration, the emitter classifier and the Fingerprint screen's `DUTY` all continue to work in true duty-cycle.
- Meter scaling is a pure, host-tested layer (`helpers/field_scale.c`); the suite is now 284 checks.

## 2.2

- **Fix: `BACK` could look dead when leaving a stealth screen.** Stealth force-darkens the display, and the old exit path only *unlocked* that force — it didn't turn the backlight back on — so a `BACK` press landed you on an unlit menu that looked frozen. Exiting a stealth screen now actively re-lights the display.
- The `BACK` contract is now explicit in every capture view (Sweep/Fingerprint/Survey/Watch): it always bubbles to the scene manager and can't be swallowed by the OK long-press handling.

## 2.1

- **Watch Mode** — an unattended monitor that stands guard between Survey and Logbook: a large mm:ss clock, live contact count, first/last-seen and peak field, plus a blinking "READER PRESENT" band. It wakes the screen the moment a reader appears and auto-logs new contacts (rate-limited). Watch never enters stealth, so it can alert you.
- **Live CSV logging** — the logbook is now written as both a grouped `logbook.txt` and a spreadsheet-friendly `logbook.csv` (`timestamp,type,detail`). Commas and newlines inside a field are scrubbed so columns never shift.
- Sensitivity level (`S:High` etc.) is now shown on the idle Sweep strip, width-measured so the waveform can't overlap it.

## 2.0

- **Fingerprint** — classifies a detected reader's polling cadence (CONTINUOUS / POLLING / INTERMITTENT) with a confidence readout and a logic-analyzer-style pulse train.
- **Site Survey** — sweeps a room over time and returns a CLEAN / TRACE / ACTIVE verdict card.
- **Logbook** — timestamped, RTC-stamped detection history saved to the SD card and browsable on-device.
- **Settings** with persistent config, **Stealth mode** (backlight + LED suppressed, sound/vibe kept), and LEFT-on-Sweep **noise-floor auto-calibration** saved as a Custom sensitivity.
- Hold-OK on Sweep/Fingerprint logs the current reading.

## 1.0

- Initial release. Passive **Sweep** detector for active 13.56 MHz NFC reader/skimmer fields using the onboard NFC chip — analog-style EMF gauge with sweep needle, peak-hold, hot-zone, live waveform, an "ACTIVE READER" alarm, and optional geiger clicks that speed up with field strength. Listen-only; never transmits.
